## Greetings

I'm Gustavo Dembicki, I work with programming since 2020 and actually I'm a Software Engineer Jr.

&nbsp;

🎯 My focus is back-end technologies, but I also work like a Full-Stack Developer.
&nbsp;

🎮 I love to play video-games and develop in my free time.
&nbsp;

💬 I appreciate to talk with you if you want about any topic, but I really like to talk about programming, career and video-games 😅.
> If you want to talk about fragile topic, I'll respect your opinion and I would like to be respected too.
&nbsp;

🌝 And that is it, if you want to talk a bit more and know me better, just call me! I'll appreciate to talk and share my experiences with you.
